Welcome to tinyOS
-----------------

this is a tiny project where i persue my desire to
create a tiny operating system and thus i accomplish
several goals:
	*learn about the ins and outs of osdev
	*learn how kernel functions
	*communicate with hardware
	*be able to change what i can

you might enjoy this os eventually. i forsee a future
that has 0 security, shitload of libs and an 
abomination of a ui, but it will be mine and i will
love it. plus it'll prolly be great for hacking
since i'll leave all the low level stuff open
and the network comm very leaky. 

enjoy!
